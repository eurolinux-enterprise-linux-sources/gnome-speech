Prerequisites
=============

gnome-speech requires the following packages:

 -  libbonobo
 -  java-access-bridge 1.4.6 or better (for Java Support)

Simple install procedure
========================

  % gzip -cd gnome-speech-0.4.25.tar.gz | tar xvf - # unpack the sources
  % cd gnome-speech-0.4.25
  % ./configure				   # run the `configure' script
  % make				   # build GTK
  [ Become root if necessary ]
  % make install			   # install GTK


Text-to-speech Engine-specific Configuration Variables
=============
Wherever possible, the GNOME Speech build system will attempt to
determine what text-to-speech engines are installed on your system,
and build the GNOME Speech drivers for those engines.  However, some
engines can not be auto-detected, and you may have an engine installed
in a non-standard location.  For these reasons, the following options
to the configure script allow you to force particular GNOME Speech
drivers to be built:

{   --with-dectalk-dir=PATH	Specify path to DECTalk}
{   --with-swift-dir=PATH	Specify path to Swift}
{   --with-theta-dir=PATH	Specify path to Theta}
{   --with-eloquence-dir=PATH	Specify path to Eloquence}
{   --with-espeak-dir=PATH	Specify path to eSpeak}
{   --with-java-home=PATH  	Use the jdk at PATH}
{   --with-freetts-dir=PATH	Specify path to FreeTTS}
