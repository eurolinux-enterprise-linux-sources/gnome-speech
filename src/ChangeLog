        * drivers/swift/swiftsynthesisdriver.c: fix for bug #559583 -
	Swift synthesis driver causes Python client to get 
        "TypeError: could not demarshal return value" on call to getAllVoices.
        The problem boils down to the Cepstral voices using varying
	upper/lower cases for the gender string and the fact that the
	driver was setting the gender to -1, which is an illegal value.
	This patch changes the swift gender string to lower case before
	doing a string compare and also defaults the value to male if
	the gender string is neither "male" nor "female".

        drivers/viavoice/viavoicesynthesisdriver.c: fix for bug 398916.
        Helps to select one of the Viavoice Chinese voices. A very basic
        test (once sentence said) has been done using Firefox 2.0 + Orca
        (2.17.90) + Gnome-speech (0.4.8) + IBM TTS (6.7.5).  More details:
        fix length of voice names (UCS-2); convert the UTF-8 text to the
        relevant charset (previously ISO-8859-1); the returned locale
        string can now include a variant (for example, instead of zh_CN,
        is returned zh_CN_GB or zh_CN_PinYin); and a memory leak has
        been fixed.

2007-01-22 Leonardo Boshell <lb@kmc.com.co>

        Fix for bug 399512 to handle config parameters better.

        * configure.in: Use AC_HELP_STRING consistently and handle --without-*
        parameters correctly. Fix the espeak_INCLUDES definition when
        --with-espeak-dir is used.

        * drivers/freetts/java/Makefile.am: Use $(GNOME_SPEECH_CLASSPATH)
        instead of $(GNOME_SPEECH_JAR_DIR) so any java-related parameters
        passed to configure actually apply.

2007-02-02 Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * configure.in: Add -lm to swift_LIBS so it will compile on

        (instead of 100).  Correct language name.  The first element of
        the voice list matches if possible the LANGUAGE variable
        (environment); otherwise the English language is the first
        element.  (Willie also made some minor modifications to
        eliminate compilation warnings).

        * INSTALL.in, configure.in, gnome-speech.spec.in,
        drivers/Makefile.am, drivers/swift/*: add first cut at Cepstral
        Swift driver.  I need to do a more thorough review of the code
        (I used the theta code as a template) to do things such as check
        for failures on calls to swift API methods and make sure it's
        not leaking memory.  There's also an issue with obtaining the
        parameter values (it will quit when you try to do a parameter
        test using test-speech) which I haven't debugged yet.

        as well as install the Java runtime.
        * drivers/freetts/java/org/GNOME/Speech/FreeTTSSynthesisDriver.java:
